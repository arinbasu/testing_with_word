Can I synchronise an article from Pages and Word to Overleaf?

Over time, free and open source LaTeX and Overleaf have become my main
tools for writing. However, I keep receiving papers from others that are
in MS Word or other formats. Using pandoc it should be possible to
change them to latex and work with overleaf. Here is a workflow.

Steps when creating a document on Word/Pages and pushing to Overleaf:

Create a document with overleaf

Set up a github link

Clone the github repo on your own computer

create a document within your own computer on word, or pages

convert the document to latex either by itself or via markdown

Use git to push the changes to github

from github pull it into overleaf

Adjust the latex
